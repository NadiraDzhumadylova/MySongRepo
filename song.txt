Just like magic
Wake up in my bed,
I just wanna have a good day (Mmm, ah)
Think it in my head,
then it happens how it should, ayy
Twelve o'clock, I got a team meeting,
then a meditation at like 1:30
Say, lookin' at my phone
But I'm tryna disconnect it (oh, yeah)
Read a fuckin' book
I be tryna stay connected (yeah)
Say it's tricky at the top
Gotta keep a slim ego for a thick wallet
Losing friends left and right
But I just send 'em love and light (oh, whoa)
Just like magic
Just like magic
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it, ayy
Just like magic
I'm attractive
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it
